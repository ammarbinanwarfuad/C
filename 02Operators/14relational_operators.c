/*  Relational Operators

Relational operators are used to compare two operands and return a true or false value. The relational operators in C are:

        ==: Equal to
        !=: Not equal to
        <: Less than
        >: Greater than
        <=: Less than or equal to
        >=: Greater than or equal to
